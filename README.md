# ***Encryption App***

#### This project is a basic Encryption App, it contains the basics of Encryption Algorithms
- ***EX: ASCII, Caesar, 1 to base 64 and Hill Encryption Algorithm types.***
- ***I also used GUNA UI framework and Circular Progress Bar in this project.***
- ***For more info about GUNA UI framework ðŸ‘‰ [Link](https://gunaui.com/)***

## ***What is Encryption and What it means?***

- ***Encryption is the process of scrambling or enciphering data so it can be read only by someone with the means to return it to its original state. It is a crucial feature of a safe and trustworthy Internet. It helps provide data security for sensitive information.***

- ***Encryption is commonly used to protect data stored on computer systems and data transmitted via computer networks, including the Internet. Financial transactions and private messaging communications often use encryption to increase security. Encryption is important when we need to find out whether data has been tampered with (data integrity), to increase peopleâ€™s confidence that they are communicating with the people they think are communicating with (authentication) and to be sure that messages were sent and received (non-repudiation).***

## ***How Encryption works?***

- ***For data communicated over a network, modern encryption scrambles data using a secret value or key known only by the recipient and the sender. For stored data, the secret value is typically known only by the data owner. There are different types of encryption and the best systems balance safety and efficiency.***

## ***What is ASCII Encryption?***

- ***This algorithm is used to encrypt data by using ASCII values of the data to be encrypted. The secret key used will be modified to another string and that string is used as a key to encrypt or decrypt the data. [3] So, it can be said that it is a kind of symmetric encryption algorithm.***

## ***What is Caesar Encryption?***

- ***In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence***
